# About Mobile Application
This mobile application is required to connect **PhysicalAuth** hardware. With this application, you can;

 - **List** saved secretKeys to your device
 - **Add** new secretKey to your device
 - **Update** secretKey details from your device
 - **Delete** your old and not used secretKeys

This application only works when you are connected to same network with your device. As your device is set to be isolated in Local Area Network (LAN) remote access is not possible.

This application is basically a communication device between you and your hardware and it acts like a **REST** Client.

# Requirements
The requirements are much more less than hardware side :smile:
All you need is an Android or iOS device that can connect to internet.

Mobile application is developed using **Flutter** to provide cross-platform support.

# Getting Ready
Currently the application is at development phase and it is not available through Google Play Store or App Store. It is planned to be live on Google Play Store initially. If you don't want to wait, you can clone this project and build project. With this way you will have access to version alpha.
